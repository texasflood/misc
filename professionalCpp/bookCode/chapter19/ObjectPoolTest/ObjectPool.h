// template class ObjectPool
//
// Provides an object pool that can be used with any class that provides a
// default constructor.
//
// The object pool constructor creates a pool of objects, which it hands out
// to clients when requested via the acquireObject() method. When a client is
// finished with the object it calls releaseObject() to put the object back
// into the object pool.
//
// The constructor and destructor on each object in the pool will be called only
// once each for the lifetime of the program, not once per acquisition and release.
//
// The primary use of an object pool is to avoid creating and deleting objects
// over and over. The object pool is most suited to applications that use large 
// numbers of objects for short periods of time.
//
// For efficiency, the object pool doesn't perform sanity checks.
// Expects the user to release every acquired object exactly once.
// Expects the user to avoid using any objects that he or she
// has released.
//
// Expects the user not to delete the object pool until every object
// that was acquired has been released. Deleting the object pool invalidates
// any objects that the user had acquired, even if they had not yet been released.
