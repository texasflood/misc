Compile ArticleCitationsTest.cpp with the ArticleCitations.cpp from any
of the four subdirectories. You don't need to change the path of the include
of ArticleCitations.h in ArticleCitationsTest.cpp because it is identical
in all four subdirectories.

Example command-line:

>g++ -o Test ArticleCitationsTest.cpp FinalVersion/ArticleCitations.cpp
